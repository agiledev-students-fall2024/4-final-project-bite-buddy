## Bite Buddy's History
Bite Buddy started with a different vision in mind. Initially, we set out to create a social app where people could meet through cooking, forming connections based on their shared culinary interests. However, as we worked through the concept, we realized we faced a major challenge: designing the right criteria for matching users based on their cooking preferences and habits. Without a clear way to build those connections, the project stalled.

Still passionate about the food theme, we began to explore other ideas. We noticed a gap in the market—while there are plenty of recipe apps, there aren’t many that help users actively learn and track their cooking progress in real life. We were inspired by how apps like Strava track fitness journeys and foster a sense of community, and realized that cooking needed something similar.

That’s when Bite Buddy was born—a platform where users can log their cooking activities, track their progress, and share their culinary experiences with a community, all while improving their skills. It’s not just about the recipes; it’s about the journey of becoming a better cook, one meal at a time.
