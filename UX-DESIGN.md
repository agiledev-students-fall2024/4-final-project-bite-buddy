## Progression Pages

### Activity Progress

Page shows user progression in a certain type of food category, giving user incentive to learn new foods and boast their profile to the community!
 - Progression is self approved with a picture of confirmation by user.
 - Progression is split by categorical descriptions of how difficult it is to make that food (i.e. novel vs expert difficulty recipes).

## Social Pages (Messaging and Communities)

### Messaging
Messaging where you can match with a partner to message and rate each other's food, perhaps making new friends!
 - Users are given the ability to rate other people's food and chat with others based on presentation and their description of how they made the dish
 - This can serve to boost the "scores" aside from challenges and recipe progression such that the user can progress to the next level quicker.
